I used Bootstrap 4, to optimize the time and adding predefined classes for margins paddings and flex box that allow me go faster and write less styles and media queries

I used sass for the styles compiled with a gulpfile.js and node.

Didn't add any js because I only focussed in the right layout and the responsiviness of it
